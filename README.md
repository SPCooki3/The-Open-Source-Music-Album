# The-Open-Source-Music-Album
Github is all about forking and improving on the original open source product. What if we implied this to music? I wanted this to be about community collaboration and innovation. So here's my proposition: A music album made by a single project file, going through a network of forks, modifying said project. 

Rules: 
1. Use FL Studio (latest version since you can't open newer projects in old versions) so you can open .flp files
2. Samples you use should be packed into your fork, VSTs not so much as that would be illegal.
3. Export your song using the highest quality settings on either FLAC or WAV, just in case your project file breaks for some reason or the person doesn't have your VSTs.
